        <h3>‘WandaVision’ Review: That’s Why They Became the Disney+ Bunch</h3>
        <h5>BY MIKE HALE</h5>
        <p>
          R.I.P., “Jessica Jones,” “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways” and all
          your first-wave Marvel Television comrades. You were a motley bunch,
          scattered across the TV and streaming landscape, but you provided some
          solid entertainment value over the last seven years, until the
          corporate Thanos in Burbank decided your time was up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those dozen or so shows are gone now, like residents of an errant time
          line, and Marvel Studios is starting over, producing its own extensive
          roster of superhero series for its shiny new corporate cousin,
          Disney+. They will be reliable members of the Marvel Cinematic
          Universe team, fitting more snugly into the continuity of that vast
          narrative-industrial complex and probably subject to a higher degree
          of analytics and storytelling-by-committee than their predecessors.
        </p>
        <p>
          So it’s unexpected that, after some shuffling of schedules because of
          the pandemic, the first product of this new regime — “WandaVision,”
          premiering with two episodes (out of nine) Friday on Disney+ — is an
          odd duck, a high-concept combination of paranoiac mystery and
          nostalgic pop-culture burlesque. Its two central characters are
          borrowed from the “Avengers” movies but they’re in very different
          territory here, more reminiscent in some ways of the most distinctive
          of the earlier Marvel shows, FX’s “Legion.” Or of one of the more
          metafictional episodes of “The Simpsons,” though not nearly as funny.
        </p>
        <p>
          Odd does not, by itself, equal good, and on the evidence of the three
          episodes made available for review, the eccentricities of
          “WandaVision” are mostly just weighing it down. It feels as if we’re
          still waiting for the real show to get started, and even with
          half-hour episodes (reminiscent of the hit Disney+ sci-fi serial, “The
          Mandalorian”) that’s a long time to wait. “The Mandalorian” had the
          good sense to introduce Baby Yoda in Episode 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          “WandaVision” takes two of the lesser Avengers, the telekinetic Wanda
          Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and the embodied artificial intelligence
          Vision (Paul Bettany) — important in the plots of the films but not at
          the top of the call sheets — and plops them into a new plane of
          existence. They are, for reasons initially unexplained (though very
          gradually suggested), living not just in a 1960s-style suburban idyll
          but also in lovingly produced parodies of actual vintage TV comedies:
          “Bewitched,” “The Brady Bunch,” “The Dick Van Dyke Show” (with touches
          of “I Love Lucy”).

        <p>
          Wanda and Vision, when they think about it, have no more idea than we
          do about what’s going on or how they got there. They struggle, in
          broad comic fashion, to hide their powers while going through sitcom
          rites like hosting a dinner party for the boss or putting on a magic
          act for a town fund-raiser.
        </p>
        <p>
          These scenes — the show-within-whatever-it-turns-out-to-be-within —
          are presented in an authentically flat black-and-white, with sudden
          shifts into deeply saturated color that hint at another world. The
          characters around Wanda and Vision, including an oversharing neighbor
          played by Kathryn Hahn and a new confidante of Wanda’s played by
          Teyonah Parris, enact exaggerated sitcom camaraderie while betraying
          flashes of knowledge that things aren’t hunky-dory.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the term-paper plane where a certain portion of comics-fan love
          plays out, “WandaVision” has a lot to offer. The situation comedy
          meets the science-fiction conspiracy thriller on the common ground of
          manufactured reality. Characters with exceptional powers and histories
          are forced to efface their identities in a simulacrum of
          mid-20th-century suburban conformity. “The Brady Bunch”!
        </p>
        <p>
          Moment by moment, though, the show’s execution of its premise is less
          fun for the viewer than it evidently was for the creative team, which
          was led by the director Matt Shakman and the head writer, Jac
          Schaeffer. The classic-comedy pastiche is skillful, affectionate and
          well-performed, but it’s not terribly imaginative — if anything, it’s
          a little too true to its antiquated sources.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s also not very funny, which is a continuing disappointment even if
          it’s at least partly intentional. An associated problem, and perhaps
          the central one, is that there’s a disconnect between the sitcom
          reality and the sci-fi reality — the humor and the terror aren’t
          working together, they aren’t amplifying each other. Much of the time,
          you’re just watching a sitcom parody and wondering why the mysterious
          forces in control needed it to be so detailed.

        <p>
          It’s not uncommon for TV series to be overthought, but “WandaVision,”
          through three episodes, feels like an extreme case; you could even go
          so far as to call it over-intellectualized. There may be some Marvel
          nerd-king arrogance at play, too. (On a related note, there’s probably
          never been a series with closing credits this elaborate. I thought
          they might be a put-on, but they’re there every episode.)
        </p>
        <p>
          This could all change, and improve, as the larger framework of the
          story is revealed, a process that seems underway by the end of the
          third episode; not being able to review more of the season reflects
          another Marvel-Disney tic: extreme spoiler paranoia. It may be worth
          the wait, because Olsen and Bettany, both fine actors, didn’t have
          much room to work in the films (though Bettany was still the best
          thing about “Avengers: Infinity War”).
        </p>
        <p>
          “WandaVision” gives them more of a showcase. So far, that has
          consisted of gamely re-enacting sitcom tropes, but maybe they’ll
          eventually get to unleash their powers.
