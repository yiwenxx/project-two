          <p>
            The residents of Meigs County, Ohio, live beneath the towering
            smokestacks of four coal-fired power plants. A fifth plant has been
            proposed, the latest salvo in a battle over the way the U.S. gets
            electricity.

        <p>
          Since 2001, U.S. energy companies have proposed more than 150 new coal
          plants. But a loose network of environmental activists, aided by
          uncertain economic conditions, has forced plans for more than 100 of
          the plants to be abandoned. Dozens more are clogged up in the court
          systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          One such coal fight is unfolding in Meigs County, Ohio, which is
          already surrounded by four coal-fired power plants. American Municipal
          Power has proposed building a new Meigs County coal plant, slated to
          begin construction late this year or in early 2010.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following information provides background to explain why coal
          plants are at the center of a national debate over energy production
          and consumption.

                Nearly 50 percent of U.S. electricity comes from coal.
                Coal-fired power plants burn coal to generate steam, which is
                used to turn the turbines of an electrical generator. The U.S.
                has one of the largest coal reserves in the world and burns it
                at about 600 plants across the nation. Generating electricity
                from coal is common in the South and in the heartland, but less
                often used in regions such as the West Coast, where
                hydroelectricity and natural gas are bigger sources of power.

                Coal plants emit carbon dioxide, a major ingredient in climate
                change.
              </div>
              <div class="tab-content">
                In recent years, NASA climate scientist James Hansen has
                advocated a moratorium on building new coal plants until
                technology is developed to prevent the carbon dioxide from
                escaping into the atmosphere.
              </div>
              <div class="tab-content">
                Hansen has warned that continuing to release carbon dioxide at
                current rates – even just for the next 10 years – will create “a
                different planet – one without sea ice in the Arctic; with
                worldwide, repeated coastal tragedies associated with storms and
                a continuously rising sea level.”

                The proposed American Municipal Power plant in Meigs County
                would release an estimated 5.5 million tons of carbon dioxide
                annually, according to CARMA, a nonprofit group.

                Coal has been a dominant industry for most of the region’s
                history. The county’s newest mine began producing coal last
                February.

                An experimental site for carbon capture and sequestration, a

                construction in West Virginia near Meigs County's southern
                border. In addition, a coal-to-liquids facility and two other
                coal-fired power plants have been proposed for the region,
                although at least some of those plans appear to be on hold.

                Meanwhile, Meigs County is one of the poorest counties in Ohio,
                according to 2000 U.S. Census data. Elisa Young, a Meigs County
                resident who has organized opposition to the new plant, argues
                that poverty reduces local opposition to the coal industry.

                In 2007, the four existing coal plants near Meigs County
                released millions of pounds of toxic chemicals, including
                arsenic, chromium, manganese, mercury, sulfuric acid aerosols
                and selenium, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

                Each of these chemicals has been linked to human health

                Kent Carson, a spokesperson for American Municipal Power, said

              <div class="tab-content">
                It can be hard to prove that any one of the chemicals caused
                health problems of a particular individual.

              <div class="tab-content">
                “We’re exposed to a soup of chemicals,” said Kevin Crist,
                director of the Center for Air Quality at Ohio University. Crist
                said health problems can be influenced by interactions between
                chemicals, as well as by lifestyle factors.
              </div>
              <div class="tab-content">
                In addition, low income – a common characteristic in Meigs
                County – is correlated with health problems. One reason is that
                poor people are more likely to smoke than their wealthier
                counterparts. More than 30 percent of adult residents of
                Southeast Ohio smoke, compared to only about 25 percent of
                residents of other Ohio counties.
              </div>
              <div class="tab-content">
                Crist said tall smokestacks on the existing plants probably
                disperse most pollutants away from Meigs County. But he said it
                is impossible to know for sure what residents are being exposed
                to, because no agency monitors the county’s air.
