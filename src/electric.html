            The U.S. energy grid is in trouble. The crumbling infrastructure and
            lag in construction of power lines have set the stage for more
            serious and frequent blackouts in the coming years.

        <h3>Smart Grid could re-energize an aging system</h3>
        <h5>BY COURTNEY WOO</h5>
        <p>
          At 5 p.m. after a long day’s work, you drive your plug-in electric car
          to your garage. The car’s battery is fairly full because you drove
          little today. You plug your car into a charging station, but rather
          than recharge, you de-charge, pumping excess energy back into the
          power grid system and helping meet peak energy demand.
        </p>
        <p>
          “It’s like the Internet,” says Dr. Alex Huang, an electrical
          engineering professor at North Carolina State University, “but rather
          than share bits of information—such as Twitter messages and YouTube
          links—you share electrons.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharing energy is just one use of what has been dubbed the Smart Grid,
          a leaner, more intelligent version of the existing grid. As
          envisioned, it would use information technology and two-way digital
          communications to increase grid productivity, diagnose and treat its
          own problems, and allow consumers to better manage their energy use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Experts claim this technology will save money for both consumers and
          utilities and will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Department of
          Energy, for example, estimates that increasing the grid’s efficiency
          by 5 percent would be the equivalent of removing 53 million cars from
          the road. But some observers note the high cost of equipment to
          operate a smart grid system could short-circuit the effort.

            Xiaohu Zhou, a Ph.D. student in electrical engineering at North
            Carolina State University, is working on a power electronics
            converter for a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle charging station. A
            charging station allows electricity to flow in and out of the grid,
            making cars a source of electricity storage.

          The way the grid stands now, utilities transmit power whenever a user
          flips a switch. Companies cannot monitor where the energy actually
          goes or where it is lost along the lines. During peak hours, companies
          meet demand by using backup “peaker plants,” such as coal-fired power
          plants, or by buying energy on the stock market. The expense
          eventually is passed to the consumer, and because the backup system
          generally relies on dirtier generation methods, it produces more
          carbon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Homes with smart meters connected to the Smart Grid could help to
          reduce lost power and save money. For example, a consumer could
          program his or her air-conditioning system to raise the thermostat in
          warm weather when demand for air conditioning rises or prices are
          high.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Smart Grid could also increase access to distributed generation,
          or on-site renewable energy sources. Huang envisions intelligent homes
          equipped with small-scale solar generation units that could feed a
          large battery located at the edge of town.
        </p>
        <p>
          “When demand is high, it’s more economical to use energy stored in a
          battery rather than turn on a coal-fired power plant,” Huang says. In
          addition to his work at North Carolina State University, Huang directs
          the National Science Foundation’s FREEDM Systems Center, which is
          developing Smart Grid components capable of storing and distributing
          renewable energy.
        </p>
        <p>These transitions will not happen overnight.</p>
        <p>
          The Department of Energy would like to see a comprehensive national
          Smart Grid by 2030. In northern Kentucky and parts of Ohio, Duke
          Energy, the nation’s third largest electric utility, will install
          700,000 electric smart meters and 450,000 natural gas smart meters
          during the next five to seven years. The installation will cover 84
          percent of Duke Energy’s utility customers in these two states.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developing this system is also costly. Although Duke Energy has
          allocated $1 billion for hardware installation in Ohio, Indiana and
          the Carolinas over five years, these funds "won’t build our entire
          service area,” says Paige Layne, the marketing communications manager
          for Smart Grid technology at Duke Energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The future cost to consumers will vary by state. In Ohio, for example,
          consumer rates increased 50 cents per month this year and will
          increase by $1.50 in 2010. But since customers will be better able to
          manage their consumption with Smart Grid technology, the bills will go
          down, says David Mohler, vice president and chief technology officer
          for Duke Energy. Last year, 35 participants in a pilot study in
          Cincinnati reduced their consumption by 10 to 20 percent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The biggest challenge is battery technology, Mohler says. Vehicle
          batteries require a carrying capacity thousands of times that of a
          cell phone battery. Engineers have yet to develop one that is both
          cheap and reliable.
        </p>
        <p>Still, pilot projects provide a glimpse of the future.</p>
        <p>
          Xcel Energy aims to make Boulder, Colo., the first “smart” city by the
          end of 2009. And Duke Energy has already launched a self-healing grid
          in Hendersonville, N.C. When a tree fell on Duke Energy lines in June
          2009, a nearby network station sensed and isolated the problem area.
          The station sent an automatic SOS to Duke Energy, quarantined the
          outage, and rerouted power to affected homes and businesses in a
          matter of seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without this intelligence, homeowners must report disruptions to the
          power company. Then a team of linemen rides the lines—through forests
          and up mountains with flashlights if necessary—to locate the injury.
          In the Hendersonville case, an additional 1,500 customers would have
          lost power.
        </p>
        <p>
          “With Smart Grid, you don’t have to worry,” says Huang, “because
          software and communication take over.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But developing a Smart Grid system alone will not solve all the
          problems of the existing grid or eliminate the need for additional
          power lines to acquire electricity from renewable resources, Mohler
          says. “Ultimately, we need to do both.”
