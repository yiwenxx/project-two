          <i>WandaVision</i>, the first Marvel project to hit our screens in a
          year and half, stands out from the rest of the Marvel Cinematic
          Universe. On its face, the show, which debuts on Disney+ on Jan. 15,
          is a send-up of family sitcoms throughout the years. The main
          character, Elizabeth Olsen’s Wanda Maximoff, has mind-control
          superpowers. After suffering great trauma in the MCU films, she seems
          to have retreated into a fantasy of her own creation, specifically
          living with her paramour, an android named Vision (Paul Bettany), in a
          suburban home with a white picket fence.
        </p>
        <p>
          In each episode, the two characters play a married couple in a
          different decade of television: in the first, Wanda and Vision play a
          married ’50s couple a la I Love Lucy; the second pays homage to the
          1960s’ I Dream of Jeanie; the third references the mostly ’70s-set The
          Brady Bunch, and so on.

              <div class="tab-content">
                Wanda and Vision are two key superheroes on the Avengers team.
                They fight evil and protect innocent lives, as superheroes do.
                Vision is an android created by Tony Stark (Iron Man).

              <label class="tab-label" for="q2">What are their powers? </label>
              <div class="tab-content">
                They both have weirdly ill-defined powers in the movies. Wanda
                can control things with her mind—via telekinesis, telepathy,
                mind control. She can shoot energy balls out of her hands and
                create protective barriers around herself and others and hover
                in the air. But there’s also a scene in which she seems to use
                her mind to torture a bad guy.
              </div>
              <div class="tab-content">
                They both have superhuman stamina, speed, strength, etc. You
                know, run-of-the-mill superhero stuff. Or, in Wanda’s case,
                mutant stuff.
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="tab">
              <input type="checkbox" id="q3" />
              <label class="tab-label" for="q3"
                >I thought Wanda was an Avenger. She’s one of the X-Men?
              </label>
              <div class="tab-content">
                Technically, yes, in the comics Wanda is a mutant, which is
                defined as a human born with a specific gene that gives them
                powers. Most of the Avengers are humans who gained their powers
                later in life, like Captain America did when the military
                injected him with super-soldier serum or Spider-Man did when
                that pesky Spider took a bite out of him.
              </div>
              <div class="tab-content">
                That difference is significant in the comics because mutants
                tend to be treated worse than other humans: they’re feared and
                discriminated against and hunted down. It’s unclear whether the
                movie version of Wanda is a mutant. She was experimented upon,
                but it’s ambiguous whether those experiments gave her her powers
                or just awoke powers that already existed. It’s a truly nerdy
                debate.
              </div>
              <div class="tab-content">
                Why does the distinction matter in the context of WandaVision?
                Well, Disney didn’t own the rights to the X-Men until they
                acquired Fox in 2019. Wanda (Scarlet Witch) and her brother
                Pietro (Quicksilver) were border cases, so both Fox and Disney
                were allowed to use the characters. Now that Disney owns both
                the Avengers and X-Men properties, some fans have speculated
                that Disney will use WandaVision and some crazy parallel
                universe logic to usher the X-Men into the MCU.
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="tab">
              <input type="checkbox" id="q4" />
              <label class="tab-label" for="q4"
                >What are the origins of the WandaVision story in the
                comics?</label
              >
              <div class="tab-content">
                The show seems to be very loosely based on several comic book
                stories in which either Wanda or Vision tries to “fit in” to
                life in suburbia with disastrous results. In the comics, Vision
                and Wanda married in 1975’s Avengers #4 and even got their own
                spinoff comic, Vision and the Scarlet Witch, in 1982. They
                fought alongside the Avengers and had twin boys named William
                and Thomas.
              </div>
              <div class="tab-content">
                In the 1989 comic storyline “Vision Quest,” Vision is destroyed
                by an international network of spies who decide he’s a threat to
                the world. Though Hank Pym reassembles him, the Vision that
                emerges has no emotional connection to his wife or children.
                Wanda’s world begins to fall apart. She is even told by her
                neighbor and mentor, a witch named Agatha Harkness, that her
                children aren’t real but rather an illusion conjured by a
                combination of her own powers and those of Maphisto, the devil
                of the Marvel Universe.
              </div>
              <div class="tab-content">
                Another comic series, 2016’s The Vision, riff on the theme of
                superheroes trying to blend in. In that comic, Vision creates an
                android wife and two kids for himself and moves them all to the
                suburbs of Washington, D.C. Their white picket fence lifestyle
                ends in tragedy when a Vision’s android wife kills a human
                viciously trying to attack the couple’s android daughter.
              </div>
              <div class="tab-content">
                So, yeah, all of this points to the likelihood that WandaVision
                won’t end with a pretty little bow on it.

              </label>
              <div class="tab-content">
                Wanda and Vision both enter the MCU in the second Avengers film,
                Avengers: Age of Ultron. A Nazi splinter group called HYDRA gets
                its hands on an Infinity Stone called the Mind Stone. The mind
                stone, in particular, can be used to control people’s minds.
              </div>
              <div class="tab-content">
                HYDRA uses the mind stone to experiment on a bunch of people and
                try to build a super army. The only ones who survive are Wanda
                and her twin brother Pietro. Wanda gains telepathy, telekinesis
                and a mishmash of other abilities. Pietro gets super speed.
              </div>
              <div class="tab-content">
                Eventually the Avengers acquire the Mind Stone from Hydra, and
                Tony Stark uses it to create a defense program called Ultron
                because Tony is an egomaniac who can’t see how that plan might
                go horribly wrong. Predictably, Ultron goes berserk and tries to
                kill the Avengers. Ultron recruits Wanda and Pietro to his
                cause.
              </div>
              <div class="tab-content">
                In a future movie, Captain America: Civil War, Wanda
                accidentally kills a bunch of innocent citizens while saving
                Captain America’s life. She’s put under house arrest, and she
                and Vision begin a flirtation while she’s stuck in the Avengers’
                compound, and he’s sent there to guard her.

                WandaVision?
              </label>
              <div class="tab-content">
                A number of supporting characters from various MCU films are set
                to appear in WandaVision: Monica Rambeau, Jimmy Woo, Darcy
                Lewis, HYDRA, and SHIELD and SWORD etc.

              </label>
              <div class="tab-content">
                It certainly seems that way. It’s unclear why Wanda has not been
                a bigger part of the Avengers’ story up until this point. When
                she fought Thanos in Avengers: Endgame, he asked her, “Who are
                you again?” which is just rude considering she and Thor are the
                only ones who came remotely close to actually defeating him in
                Infinity War.
              </div>
              <div class="tab-content">
                Wanda can control people’s minds, control objects with her mind
                and, apparently, build entire universes with her mind. On top of
                that she can fight physically by throwing energy balls and
                levitating, which is basically flying.
              </div>
              <div class="tab-content">
                Whether she becomes a hero or a villain in the future of the
                MCU, she’s sure to play a big role.

              >
              <div class="tab-content">
                The first season, assuming this isn't a "limited" one-and-done
                run, is listed as nine episodes. For the first episode, which as
                mentioned above is based on shows such as I Love Lucy, scenes
                were filmed before a studio audience.

                WandaVision will launch on Disney+ on 15 January. For more on
                the show, you can still buy Empire's January 2021 issue, which
